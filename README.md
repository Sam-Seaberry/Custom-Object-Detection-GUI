# Custom-Object-Detection-GUI
Custom trained object detection model training GUI using Tensorflow and PyQt5.


Lable images and train your own object detection model to identify and locate anything! If you want to start training right away without needing to deal with python dependency pains go to https://www.samseaberry.com/objectdetectiongui and download the windows executable. This exe is built with CX_Freexe using the code from this repo. GPU support is available with the correct drivers installed, cuDNN 8.6 and CUDA 11.8. Note that without CUDA and cuDNN installed training will be VERY slow (unless you are on a top-tier desktop CPU). A step-by-step howto can be found in the "Help" toolbar of the exe or in this repo. 

Ongoing project slowly adding more features and enhancing UI.
